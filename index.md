<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am currently engaged in research related to **Intelligent Transportation Systems** and **Machine Learning**. My work focuses on applying data-driven methods to solve real-world transportation problems.

My research lies at the intersection of **Intelligent Transportation Systems** and **Computer Science**, with a special focus on building predictive and decision-making models for traffic flow, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). My research interests include **traffic prediction**, **data mining**, **intelligent decision-making**, and **autonomous systems**.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in **Transportation** at [Chang'an University](https://en.chd.edu.cn/). Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in **Computer Science** at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/).

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in **Intelligent Transportation Systems**, **Machine Learning**, and related fields, with a focus on interdisciplinary research that bridges **transportation engineering** and **computer science**.
