<h2 id="about-me" style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am pursuing a Master's degree in **Computer Science** at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in **Transportation** at [Chang'an University](https://en.chd.edu.cn/).

My research lies at the intersection of **Intelligent Transportation Systems** and **Computer Science**, where I develop data-driven solutions for next-generation mobility systems. My research interests include:

- **Internet of Vehicles (IoV)**
- **Traffic Flow Prediction**
- **Autonomous Vehicle Systems**
- **Intelligent Decision-Making**
- **Transportation Data Mining**

My work focuses on applying machine learning techniques and robust modeling approaches to address real-world transportation challenges and develop intelligent mobility solutions.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities to advance research in **Intelligent Transportation Systems** and **Machine Learning**. My goal is to contribute to next-generation mobility through interdisciplinary research that bridges **transportation engineering** and **artificial intelligence**.
